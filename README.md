# IMDB Reviews Sentiment Classifier  

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project using a deep learning model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for sentiment classification tasks, and is deployed via **Streamlit** for easy interaction.

## Features  

- **Deep Learning Model**: A neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras for text sentiment analysis.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, padding, and text vectorization for efficient model input.  
- **Interactive Web Application**: A Streamlit app for user-friendly sentiment analysis of custom text inputs.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis and training process documented step by step.  

## Try the App  

You can try the live version of this app here: [IMDB Sentiment Classifier App](#)  

*(Replace `#` with the actual link once the app is deployed.)*

## Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository-url>  
   cd imdb-reviews-sentiment-classifier  
   ```  

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS  
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows  
   ```  

3. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## How to Use  

### Run Locally  

1. **Start the Streamlit app**:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app/app.py  
   ```  

2. **Interact with the app**:  
   - Input custom text to classify its sentiment as positive or negative.  

### Use the Notebook  

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook notebooks/imdb-reviews-sentiment-classifier.ipynb  
   ```  

2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to:  
   - Preprocess the dataset  
   - Train the sentiment analysis model  
   - Evaluate its performance  

## Dataset  

The project uses the **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset**, a widely used benchmark for sentiment classification tasks.  

**Dataset Details**:  
- Includes 25,000 labeled reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.  
- Binary sentiment labels: positive and negative.  

## Model Details  

The deep learning model leverages the following techniques:  
- Text tokenization and padding using TensorFlow/Keras utilities.  
- Embedding layers to handle textual input.  
- A sequence of dense layers for classification.  

The pre-trained model is saved in the `models/` folder as `model.keras`.
